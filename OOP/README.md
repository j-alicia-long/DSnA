# Object-Oriented Programming
OOP Fundamentals, mostly written in Java

## Abstraction

## Encapsulation

## Inheritance
### Multiple Inheritance
- One child inherits from two parent classes

In Python: Multiple inheritance is done as an ordered list (in the order of parents listed)
- Solves the diamond problem, where both parents inherit from the same grandparent and there is ambiguity in method override resolution.
