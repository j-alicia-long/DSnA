# Technical Interview Tips

## Must Dos for successful interviews
- Talk the entire time
  - What data structures you're using
  - Tradeoffs of different approaches
  - Edge cases that could break the solution
  - Run times
  - Bugs found and how to fix them
  - What you are NOT doing (ex. assumptions about input)

Framework
  ```
  1. Get all problem info (CLARIFY)
  2. Basic solution (brute force)
  3. Efficient solution
  4. Test cases - iterate between 3-4
  5. Extras - run time, space, potential improvements
  ```


## Tips and Tricks
- Adding "Why" you are doing something
  ```
    - OK: "Now I'm going to do a for loop from 0 to i"
    - GREAT: "Because I need to look at every value, I am going to do a for loop..."
  ```
- Outline a solution at the beginning
  - Use comments, pseudocode, whatever gives enough details
- Record variable changes during test cases
- Ask questions!
  ```
    - "Am I on the right track?"
    - "Are there edge cases you think I am missing?"
  ```
