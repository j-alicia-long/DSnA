# Technical Interview Tips

## Must Dos for successful interviews
- Talk the entire time
  - What data structures you're using
  - Tradeoffs of different approaches
  - Edge cases that could break the solution
  - Run times
  - Bugs found and how to fix them
  - What you are NOT doing (ex. assumptions about input)

Framework
  ```
  1. Get all problem info (CLARIFY)
  2. Basic solution (brute force)
  3. Efficient solution
  4. Test cases - iterate between 3-4
  5. Extras - run time, space, potential improvements
  ```
