# Misc Concepts
Mostly written in Python

## Bit Manipulation
See bit_operators.py for python implementation details

## Memory (Stack vs. Heap)


## Big O Time & Space
### O(1) - Constant
Examples:
- Array access

### O(2^n) - Exponential
Examples:
- Iterating through a powerset (all possible subsets)
- Fibonacci
  - Recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N by recursively solving two smaller problems of size N-1
