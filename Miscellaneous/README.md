# Misc Concepts
Mostly written in Python

## Bit Manipulation
See bit_operators.py for python implementation details

Typical Bitmask Problems
- Identify an array element (or elements), which appears exactly given number of times. 
  - Likely Solution: build an array bitmask using XOR operator.
  - Examples: In-Place Swap, Single Number, Single Number II.

## Memory (Stack vs. Heap)


## Big O Time & Space
Here are some basic Big O examples, ordered from best to worst:

### O(1) - Constant
Examples:
- Array access

### O(log n) - Logarithmic
Examples:
- Binary search

### O(n) - Linear
Examples:
- Simple search

### O(n log n) - Log-Linear
Examples:
- Sorting (Quicksort, Mergesort)

### O(n^2) - Quadratic
Examples:
- Sorting (Selection sort)

### O(2^n) - Exponential
Examples:
- Iterating through a powerset (all possible subsets)
 - Note: Powerset can be found by counting in binary
- Fibonacci
  - Recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N by recursively solving two smaller problems of size N-1

### O(n!) - Factorial
Examples:
- Iterating through all permutations (Ex. Traveling salesperson)
