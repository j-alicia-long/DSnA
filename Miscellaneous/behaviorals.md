# Behavioral Question Tips
Not DS&A related, but still useful for interviews!


## "Tell me about yourself"
- Ice breaker - should be *memorable* and *highlight key aspects* about you as an applicant
- Have a narrative arc or theme
- Don't list accomplishments - should sound natural and authentic
- Don't assume they've read your resume - highlight key points from it
- Clean, polished, concise, and sound confident!

  ```
  1. Basic Introduction
  2. Transition to CS/Memorable part
  3. At College
  4. Common Theme
  5. Tie to Company/Intro
  ```


## "What role do you play on a team?"
Explain your role -> Be open minded -> Tell an example story

Tips:
- **Don't pigeonhole yourself**
  - Have a main role or two, but always say that you can *adapt* and do anything needed
- Use examples (STAR)
- More about teamwork than technical roles (frontend/backend)

### How to figure out your role on a team
- What's your work style?
- Would you rather code alone or with others?
- What are your key defining personality traits?
- How would your teammates describe your contributions?
- If all fails, take the Myers Briggs test
