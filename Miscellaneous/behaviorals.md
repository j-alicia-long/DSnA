# Behavioral Question Tips
Not DS&A related, but still useful for interviews!


## "Tell me about yourself"
- Ice breaker - should be *memorable* and *highlight key aspects* about you as an applicant
- Have a narrative arc or theme
- Don't list accomplishments - should sound natural and authentic
- Don't assume they've read your resume - highlight key points from it
- Clean, polished, concise, and sound confident!

  ```
  1. Basic Introduction

  2. Transition to CS/Memorable part

  3. At College

  4. Common Theme

  5. Tie to Company/Intro
  ```

## Technicals
Must Dos for successful interviews
- Talk the entire time
  - What data structures you're using
  - Tradeoffs of different approaches
  - Edge cases that could break the solution
  - Run times
  - Bugs found and how to fix them
  - What you are NOT doing (ex. assumptions about input)

Framework
  ```
  1. Get all problem info (CLARIFY)
  2. Basic solution (brute force)
  3. Efficient solution
  4. Test cases - iterate between 3-4
  5. Extras - run time, space, potential improvements
  ```
