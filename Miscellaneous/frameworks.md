# Libraries and Frameworks
An overview of each library & framework I've worked with in the past.

## Javascript
Both ReactJS and Angular are scalable, modular, component-driven tools

### ReactJS (Library)
- Written in JavaScript
- Virtual DOM (faster update rendering)
- One-way data binding
- Complete backward compatibility
- Smaller bundle size
Note: Current most popular JS framework on StackOverflow (Aug 2020)

### Angular (Framework)
- Written in *TypeScript*, for static typing & annotations
- Real DOM (slower update rendering)
- Two-way data binding
- Must install updates sequentially
- Larger bundle size
Note: Angular 2, or Angular, is a rewrite of older framework AngularJS

###Other strong contenders
- VueJS (\#2)
- Express (Backend)
- JQuery
