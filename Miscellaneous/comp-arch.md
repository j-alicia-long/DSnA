# Computer Architecture


## OS

### Process vs. Thread
- Process means a program is in execution, whereas thread means a segment of a process. 
- A Process is mostly isolated, whereas Threads share memory
  - Process does not share data, and Threads share data with each other
- A Process is not Lightweight, whereas Threads are Lightweight due to not having to copy memory
