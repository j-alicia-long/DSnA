# Data Structures
Mostly written in Python

## Linked Lists

## Trees, Tries, Graphs

### Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level order
Different ways of traversing the tree
- DFS does pre, in, and post order, while BFS does level-order
- You can rebuild any binary tree using inorder and either pre/post order traversal
  - If given just pre and post, you can only construct full binary trees

### Trie - prefix tree
- TrieNodes have a dict of children with char keys (26) that map to more TrieNodes

## Stacks & Queues

## Heaps

## Vectors/Arraylists
