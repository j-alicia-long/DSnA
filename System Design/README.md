# System Design

## Coupling & Cohesion

### Cohesion
Cohesion is a measure that defines the degree of **intra-dependability within elements** of a module.
- The **greater** the cohesion, the better the program design.

Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do.
High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class


### Coupling
Coupling is a measure that defines the level of **inter-dependability among modules** of a program. It tells at what level the modules interfere and interact with each other.
- The **lower** the coupling, the better the program.

For low coupled classes, changing something major in one class should not affect the other. 
High coupling would make it difficult to change and maintain your code; since classes are closely knit together, making a change could require an entire system revamp.

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) 
Phases, Methodologies, Process, and Models
  * 1) Requirement Gathering and Analysis.
  * 2) Design.
  * 3) Implementation or Coding.
  * 4) Testing.
  * 5) Deployment.
  * 6) Maintenance.
